## What is it?

Just exploring AST-related stuff and `codemirror`

```
yarn run dev
```

and go to [`http://localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234)

## What I've learned

- [`unified`](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified)-related, especially [`rehype`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).
- [`codemirror`](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror) in-browser text editor library.
- [`ejs`](https://github.com/mde/ejs) template engine library.
- Using [`<script type="text/template">`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4912586/explanation-of-script-type-text-template-script) for storing `ejs` template
- Mixing [`pug`](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) with `ejs`
